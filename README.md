# yii2-menu-breadcrumbs

Automatic generate the breadcrumbs with the menu setting.And try to optimizate the menu plugin.

**Test in dmstr's yii2 adminLTE asset bundle and only for it now, because this plugin extends from dmstr/menu...**

*There are some features of this plugin:*
1. Automatic generate the breadcrumbs by the menu setting.
1. Also could automatic generate the page title by the menu item label.
1. Could set the parent item active when the item is invisible which is below this parent item 
1. The item would be hidden when it link to a page user without rbac permission. (set openRbac to true)

There is a example in the viewExample.php file.

*future plan:*
1. to independent, not extends from dmstr/menu.

**If you have any question, ask to me please.**
